# OpenApi

To generate API documentation, use - [scribe](https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/)

How to describe documentation:

Documentation description occurs through PHP attributes, examples of use can be found in controllers or in documentation

The auto handles themselves are generated from the route - so we manually generate documentation through attributes

Command for generation:

```bash
make doc-generate
```
