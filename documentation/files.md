# Working with files

A ready-made file table is used to describe files, with which tables can be linked

The description of links is used with the users model

To work with files, the logic of saving to a random folder is described + changing the file name so that it is impossible to sort out the path to the file and find its location

Create a files folder in /storage/app/public - this folder is used by default to save files
